# HeroForge
A mobile app where your phone becomes a superhero dojo. You hatch and raise a powerful sidekick (think mutant, robot, cosmic creature) who gains powers only when you grow — through fitness, habits, and consistency. If you slack, they regress… and yes, they’ll lock your phone (within reason) until you complete daily “training missions.”
